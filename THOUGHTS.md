# Thoughts

Here is where I document how I approach this project, the blockers I come across, what I've learned, where I failed, and everything else related to this project.

## Approach

6/26/24 - I'm going to start off by following the README instructions which are:

1. Create `Ship` class/factory
2. Create `Gameboard` class/factory
3. Create `Player` class/factory
